# Lesson 06: Compiling CUDA on Linux

This lesson shows how to compile and run a CUDA program on Linux. It also shows why a kernel can print nothing when `cudaDeviceSynchronize()` is missing.

- Video environment: Windows 11 + WSL2 (Ubuntu), CUDA 11.5.
- Your environment: native Linux (Ubuntu 24), CUDA 13.0, NVIDIA L40S (46 GB, Ada Lovelace, sm_89).

## Source file: `project001.cu`

```c
#include "cuda_runtime.h"
#include "device_launch_parameters.h"
#include <stdio.h>

__global__ void test01()
{
    // print the blocks and threads IDs
    // warp = 32 threads. (64 threads/block) --> (64/32 = 2 warps/block)
    int warp_ID_Value = 0;
    warp_ID_Value = threadIdx.x / 32;
    printf("The block ID is %d --- The thread ID is %d --- The warp ID %d\n",
           blockIdx.x, threadIdx.x, warp_ID_Value);
}

int main()
{
    // kernel_name<<<num_of_blocks, num_of_threads_per_block>>>();
    test01 <<<2, 64>>> ();
    cudaDeviceSynchronize();
    return 0;
}
```

The launch uses 2 blocks with 64 threads each, so 128 threads in total. Each block has 64 / 32 = 2 warps.

## Step 1: verify nvcc

```bash
nvcc --version
```

Output on this machine:

```
nvcc: NVIDIA (R) Cuda compiler driver
Copyright (c) 2005-2025 NVIDIA Corporation
Built on Wed_Aug_20_01:58:59_PM_PDT_2025
Cuda compilation tools, release 13.0, V13.0.88
Build cuda_13.0.r13.0/compiler.36424714_0
```

The video uses CUDA 11.5. The compile commands are the same in both versions.

## Step 2: compile

`-o project001` sets the name of the output program. An existing file with that name is overwritten. Without `-o`, the name is `a.out`. Always using `-o` avoids confusion.

```bash
nvcc -o project001 project001.cu
```

Check that the program file exists:

```bash
ls -lh project001
```

```
-rwxrwxr-x 1 ubuntu ubuntu 966K Jun  9 21:58 project001
```

## Step 3: run

```bash
./project001
```

## The synchronization problem

At the kernel launch line, the CPU sends the kernel to the GPU. It does not wait. It goes straight to the next line. If that line is `return 0`, the program ends before the GPU prints anything.

In the video (CUDA 11.5, WSL2), output sometimes appeared and sometimes did not, depending on timing. On this machine (CUDA 13.0, L40S, native Ubuntu), the program without `cudaDeviceSynchronize()` never printed anything:

```bash
$ ./project001
$
$ ./project001
$
$ ./project001
$
```

None of the three runs printed anything. The kernel did run on the GPU. But the program ended before the GPU's print buffer was flushed (written out to the terminal).

`cudaDeviceSynchronize()` makes the CPU wait at that line until all GPU threads finish. When it returns, the print buffer is flushed and all output is on the terminal. Every run then prints the full output.

```bash
nvcc -o project001 project001.cu
./project001
```

<kernel-sync cmd="./project001" out="The block ID is 0 --- The thread ID is 0 --- The warp ID 0|The block ID is 0 --- The thread ID is 1 --- The warp ID 0|... 128 lines in total"></kernel-sync>

## Output

Full output with `cudaDeviceSynchronize()` and `<<<2, 64>>>` (128 lines):

```

On this machine, block 0 printed before block 1 in both runs. A second run gave the same 128 lines in the same order. Block order is still not guaranteed on other runs or machines.

## Compilation error debugging

To see how the compiler reports errors, remove the `;` at the end of `warp_ID_Value = threadIdx.x / 32` (line 10). Then compile again:

```bash
nvcc -o project001 project001.cu
```

Output on this machine:

```
project001.cu(9): error: expected a ";"
      printf("The block ID is %d --- The thread ID is %d --- The warp ID %d\n",
      ^

1 error detected in the compilation of "project001.cu".
```

The error points to line 9 (the `printf` line), not line 8 where the semicolon is missing. The compiler only sees the problem when it reaches the next word on line 9. So always check the line just before the one the compiler reports. Put the semicolon back, compile again, and check that the build has no errors.

## L40S-specific notes

| Parameter | Video | This machine |
|---|---|---|
| CUDA release | 11.5 | 13.0 |
| GPU | generic | NVIDIA L40S (sm_89) |
| OS | WSL2 (Ubuntu) | native Ubuntu 24 |
| Shell | cmd.exe + wsl | direct SSH |

On the L40S, it is best to name the GPU architecture when you compile. Without `-arch`, NVCC picks a safe, generic default. `-arch=sm_89` targets this GPU directly and avoids surprises.

```bash
nvcc -arch=sm_89 -o project001 project001.cu
```

Check that this toolkit supports sm_89:

```bash
nvcc --help | grep sm_89
```

```
        'sm_75','sm_80','sm_86','sm_87','sm_88','sm_89','sm_90','sm_90a'.
        'sm_86','sm_87','sm_88','sm_89','sm_90','sm_90a'.
```

## Summary

| Step | Command |
|---|---|
| Check compiler | `nvcc --version` |
| Compile | `nvcc -o project001 project001.cu` |
| Compile (L40S) | `nvcc -arch=sm_89 -o project001 project001.cu` |
| Run | `./project001` |

Add `cudaDeviceSynchronize()` after a kernel launch when the CPU needs the GPU's output or results before the program ends. Without it, this machine prints nothing at all.

## Glossary

- `nvcc`: the CUDA compiler driver. It handles host and device code in the same `.cu` file.
- `-o`: sets the output program name. The default is `a.out`.
- `-arch=sm_89`: compile for compute capability 8.9, which is the L40S (Ada Lovelace).
- `cudaDeviceSynchronize()`: makes the CPU wait until all GPU work launched so far is done.
- warp ID: the warp a thread belongs to inside its block. It is `threadIdx.x / 32`.
