Now the question is:

How can we tell which generation and architecture a GPU belongs to?

Let’s take a practical example.

Assume you want to learn more about GPUs like the RTX 3090 or the A100.

Where do you find reliable information about them?

The easiest way is simple: Search on Google.

For example: "A100 GPU TechPowerUp"

TechPowerUp is a website that collects detailed GPU specifications from many manufacturers. 

It’s one of the easiest places to quickly check GPU details.

You can do the same for other GPUs:

"RTX 3090 TechPowerUp"

Open the page, and you will see all the specs.

## A Simple Comparison

Let’s compare two GPUs:

- RTX 3090  
- A100  

One of the first things you will see is the chip name.

For example: A100 → GA100  

We will go deeper into chip design later. For now, just read the name.

Next, look at the number of cores:

- A100 → around 7,000 cores  
- RTX 3090 → more than 10,000 cores  

At first, this might look confusing.

Does this mean RTX 3090 is always stronger?

Not necessarily.

## Important Detail About Core Counts

When you see a number like: "6192 cores"

this usually refers to single-precision cores (used for standard floating-point calculations) only.

It does NOT mean the total number of all cores inside the GPU.

Modern GPUs have different types of cores, for example:

- cores for integer operations  
- cores for double-precision operations  
- special cores for AI (tensor cores)

So you should not judge a GPU only by this number.

Now let’s identify generation and architecture.

### RTX 3090

- Generation → GeForce  
- Architecture → Ampere  

GeForce GPUs are built for everyday users:

- desktops  
- laptops  
- workstations  

Main use cases:

- gaming  
- content creation  
- general GPU tasks  

### A100

- Generation → (historically Tesla, now Data Center GPUs)  
- Architecture → Ampere  

These GPUs are designed for:

- servers  
- data centers  
- supercomputers  

## Key Insight

Here is something very important:

- RTX 3090 and A100 use the SAME architecture (Ampere)  
- but they are built for completely different use cases  

So: Same architecture ≠ same purpose

Reminder:
- Architecture → technical design
- Generation → usage category

## How to Tell Them Apart Visually

Now a practical question: Can we tell the difference just by looking at the GPU?

Yes, in many cases.

### Data Center GPUs (A100, V100, P100)

- usually NO built-in fan  
- have a more compact, fanless design

Why?

Because they are used in data centers with advanced external cooling systems.  

Cooling is handled by the server infrastructure, not the GPU itself.


### GeForce GPUs (RTX series)

- have built-in fans  
- designed for standalone systems  

Why?

Because they are used in:

- desktop PCs  
- personal workstations  

These systems need their own cooling solution, so fans are required.

## Quick Summary

- Data Center GPUs → no fan  
- GeForce GPUs → built-in fan  

The reason is simple: different environments → different cooling needs  

Understanding this difference makes it much easier to:

- read GPU specs  
- choose the right hardware  
- avoid common beginner mistakes  

This will become even more important as we go deeper into CUDA.
