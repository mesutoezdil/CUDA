## Starting CUDA: What I Realized Before Writing Any Code

When I started learning CUDA, my first instinct was simple.

Write some code, run it on the GPU, and get faster results.

But very quickly, I noticed something.

It doesn’t work like that.

Just moving code to the GPU does NOT automatically give you good performance.

And that made me stop and think.

Why?

## The First Big Difference I Had to Accept

At a surface level, CPUs and GPUs look similar.

Both process data.

Both execute instructions.

But under the hood, they are built with completely different goals.

Once I understood this, everything started to make more sense.

## How I Started Comparing CPU and GPU

Instead of looking at specs, I tried to understand the mindset behind each design.

A CPU is built to handle tasks that require:

- fast response  
- complex logic  
- sequential execution  

A GPU is built for something else entirely.

It is designed to process many things at the same time.

So instead of: one complex task → very fast  

it does: many simple tasks → in parallel  

That difference is everything.

## Memory Is Also Different

Another thing I didn’t fully understand at first was memory.

CPUs use system RAM.

Everything goes through the same shared memory space.

GPUs are different.

They have their own memory, usually called VRAM.

This means:

- CPU and GPU do not automatically share data  
- data needs to be transferred between them.

And that transfer can become a bottleneck if you are not careful.

## Cache and Fast Memory (Small but Important Detail)

I also noticed that both CPU and GPU have fast internal memory layers.

But they are used differently.

CPUs rely heavily on multiple cache levels: L1, L2, L3

These are small but extremely fast.

GPUs also have cache, but they introduce something extra.

Shared memory.

This turned out to be very important.

Because it allows threads inside the GPU to cooperate efficiently.

At first, I ignored it.

Later, I realized it is one of the key tools for optimization.

## Processing Power Is Not What I Expected

Initially, I thought GPUs are stronger because they are “faster”.

But that’s not really true.

If you compare a single core:

CPUs usually run at higher frequencies.

Several GHz.

GPU cores run slower individually.

So if you compare one core vs one core: CPU wins.

## Then Where Does GPU Power Come From?

This is where everything changes.

A GPU does not rely on one powerful core.

It uses many simpler cores.

A lot of them.

So instead of finishing one task quickly, it splits work into many smaller parts.

And runs them at the same time.

That is why GPUs are powerful.

Not because each unit is strong.

But because there are so many working together.

## A Simple Way I Remember It

CPU: one task → very fast  

GPU: many tasks → at the same time  

And this explains something important.

GPUs are not always better.

They are only better when the problem can be parallelized.

If your task is sequential, a CPU can easily outperform a GPU.

## How CPU and GPU Work Together

Another thing I had to understand:

The GPU is not independent.

It works together with the CPU.

In a typical system:

- CPU manages the program  
- GPU executes parallel workloads  

They communicate through interfaces like PCIe.

So data flow looks like this:

CPU → sends data to GPU  
GPU → processes it  
GPU → sends results back  

If this flow is not handled well, performance suffers.

## Inside the GPU: The Real Work Happens Here

Once I understood the high-level picture, I looked inside the GPU.

The most important unit is something called: Streaming Multiprocessor (SM)

At first, the name sounded complicated.

But I started thinking of it like this:

An SM is a small processing unit inside the GPU.

And a GPU is just many of these SMs working together.

## What Is Inside an SM?

Each SM contains everything needed to run parallel work.

There is fast memory.

Registers, which are the fastest storage available.

There is shared memory, where threads can exchange data.

And there are control units that decide what runs and when.

But the most important part is the execution units.

## The Units That Actually Do the Work

Inside each SM, there are different types of compute units.

Each one is specialized.

Some handle floating-point operations.

These are heavily used in graphics and AI.

Some handle integer operations.

Then there are Tensor Cores.

These are specialized for matrix computations, which are critical for AI workloads.

There are also special function units.

They handle more complex math operations.

And finally, load/store units.

They move data between memory and computation units.

So the GPU is not just “many cores”.

It is a structured system of specialized units.

## One More Important Detail: L2 Cache

There is also a global cache layer.

L2 cache.

Unlike L1 or shared memory, this is not tied to a single SM.

It is shared across the whole GPU.

It is larger, but also slower.

Still, it plays a key role in reducing memory access cost.

## What This Changed for Me

At the beginning, I thought CUDA was about writing code.

But now I see something else.

It is about understanding the hardware.

Because if you don’t understand:

- how memory works  
- how parallel execution works  
- how data moves  

then you cannot use the GPU efficiently.

## Final

For me, this was a mindset shift.

GPU programming is not just coding.

It is about thinking in parallel.

And once I started seeing it that way, everything began to connect.

Especially when moving deeper into CUDA.
