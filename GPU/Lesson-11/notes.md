At some point, reading about GPUs is not enough anymore.

You need to open a real white paper.

Because that is where things stop being simplified and start becoming real. 

You are no longer reading explanations. You are looking directly at how the hardware is designed.

The Volta architecture is one of the most important examples of this. 

When you open the V100 white paper, you are not just reading about a GPU. You are looking at a moment where GPUs changed direction.

The first mistake many people make is jumping straight into diagrams or numbers.

A better starting point is the “Key Features” section.

This part is short, but it tells you what really matters. It shows what the architecture is trying to do.

In the case of Volta, the focus is very clear. The architecture is built with artificial intelligence in mind.

This is not just another improvement over the previous generation. It is a shift in purpose.

The most important change in Volta is the introduction of Tensor Cores.

Before Volta, GPUs could already run matrix operations, but they did it using general CUDA cores. That worked, but it was not efficient.

With Volta, this changes. Matrix operations get their own dedicated hardware.

This is a key moment.

It means the GPU is no longer just a general compute device. It becomes something designed for AI workloads from the ground up.

To understand what really changed, you have to look at the Streaming Multiprocessor, or SM.

This is the core building block of the GPU.

Volta introduces a redesigned SM. One of the most important improvements is that different types of operations can now run at the same time.

In earlier architectures like Pascal, integer and floating point operations shared the same execution path. They had to take turns.

With Volta, they can run in parallel.

This may sound like a small detail, but it has a big impact. Modern workloads often mix different types of operations, and this change allows better use of the hardware.

Another important point is instruction speed.

A new architecture is not only about adding more cores. It is also about making existing operations faster.

In Volta, many instructions complete in fewer cycles compared to Pascal.

In later architectures like Ampere and Hopper, this improves even more.

This shows a pattern that continues into 2026. Progress is not only about scale. It is also about efficiency.

Memory is another area where Volta improves.

It uses HBM2 memory and offers higher memory bandwidth than previous generations.

This matters because modern GPU workloads are often limited by how fast data can move, not just how fast it can be processed.

Higher bandwidth means more data can be fed into the compute units without waiting.

Volta also introduces the second generation of NVLink.

This is a technology that connects GPUs to each other with high speed.

Compared to earlier versions, Volta increases both the number of links and their speed.

This makes multi-GPU systems much more efficient.

If you look at large AI systems in 2026, especially those based on Hopper and Blackwell, you will see that this idea has become even more important. Volta is one of the first steps in that direction.

The number of transistors is another useful indicator.

The V100 GPU has around 21 billion transistors.

At first, this is just a number. But it tells you how much hardware is inside.

If you compare it with newer architectures, the difference becomes clear.

Hopper reaches around 80 billion transistors, and Blackwell goes even further with more complex designs.

This growth is not only about size. It reflects the addition of new units, new memory systems, and more advanced execution models.

One thing you start to notice when reading different white papers is consistency.

Even though the architectures change, the way they are described stays similar.

The structure is almost always the same. First, new features are introduced. Then the SM design is explained. After that, performance comparisons are shown. Finally, technical specifications are listed.

This makes learning easier over time.

Once you understand how to read one white paper, the others become much easier to follow.

Looking back from 2026, the role of Volta becomes even clearer.

It is not just a strong GPU from its time.

It is the point where GPUs became AI-focused.

Everything that comes after, Ampere, Hopper, and now Blackwell, builds on the same idea and pushes it further.

Reading the V100 white paper is not just about learning one architecture.

It is about understanding why GPUs look the way they do today.
